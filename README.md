Students and Teachers can register using URL/signup.php and Super Admin needs to verify and approve their registraion. After getting approved by super admin students and teachers can login to their own dashboard.

Super admin can add delete subjects, exam controllers, teachers and students. He can also assign subjects to teachers. At first Super Admin needs to add subjects and then assign those subjects to teachers. Then Teacher login to his dashboard and can add marks to studens by subjects that Super Amin assigned to him.
